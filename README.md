# rust-and-c

This is a sample project showing how you might integrate Rust into a C
program, and the steps towards converting a C API into Rust, of course
while keeping the C bindings in place.

It requires bindgen; install it with `cargo install bindgen`, and
remember to add $HOME/.cargo/bin to your path.
